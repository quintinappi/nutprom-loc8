## The Power of Offline Clocking

One of NutProM's standout features is its robust offline clocking capability. This feature is a game-changer for businesses with employees working in areas with unreliable internet connections or for field workers who may not always have access to cellular data.

Here's how it works:

1. **Local Storage**: When an employee clocks in or out without an internet connection, the clock event is stored securely on their device using IndexedDB.

2. **Background Sync**: Once the device regains internet connectivity, NutProM automatically syncs the stored clock events with the cloud database.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: In case of any conflicts (e.g., if a manual entry was made), the system uses intelligent algorithms to resolve discrepancies, ensuring data integrity.

4. **Seamless User Experience**: Employees don't need to worry about their connection status. They can clock in and out as usual, and the system handles the rest.

This feature ensures that your time tracking remains accurate and complete, even in challenging connectivity environments. It's particularly valuable for construction sites, remote fieldwork, or areas with poor network coverage.
